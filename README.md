Aliexpress has the M5Stack systems... many options and packages. At a minimum, you'll need
the "Basic" plus a "USB", but other combinations are possible.

# Install

- install serial port drivers for CP2104 chip from Silicon Labs
    - <https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers>
    - must enable "system extension" immediately after install
    - expect to find `/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART` when M5Stack is connected

- [download and install Ardinuo](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/quick_start/m5core/m5stack_core_quick_start)

- for MacOS, follow [this guide](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/quick_start/m5core/m5stack_core_get_started_Arduino_MacOS)

- install an additional libraries: Tools > Manage Libraries...
    - "USB Host Shield Library 2.0" .. search for "usb max"

- open "verifier.ino" and press Run

- you need the USB unit in your stack, of course.

## Making Logo

Make a nice two-colour black and white to start (in `banner.png`), then:

```
% pngtopam banner.png | pamthreshold | pamtopnm | pbmtoxbm -name od_logo > od_logo.h
```

## Balance Display

It would be great to show the current balance on screen. It's not
hard, but requires Wifi access and a backend service of some kind.
That could be an Electrum server, or a Bitcoin web service.  Wifi access
requires a setup process so the M5Stack can get a wifi password to
use, and the interaction with a back-end service may reveal your
location and/or identity plus it may tie you into future and pass
applications of the specific Opendime.

# TODO

- initialize factory-fresh Opendimes with good entropy so they will pick a key
- cycle through a few good third-part websites for balance URL's
    - click for next site
    - remember your favourite
- display current balance on screen with help of Internet connection
- improve bitcoin signed-message verification process
